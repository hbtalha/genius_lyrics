[Intro: J. Cole]
Uh

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Pride is the Devil
Think it got a hold on me
Pride is the Devil
It left so many R.I.P. 
Pride is the Devil
Think it got a hold on me
Pride is the Devil, yeah, uh

[Post-Chorus: J. Cole]
Terrified, paranoid, I'll put you over everything to fill the void
And when you’re gone, will I have anything or will I be destroyed? Uh
Terrified, paranoid, I'll put you over everything to fill the void
And when you're gone, will I have anything or will I be destroyed? Yеah

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Bright lights pass me in the city, it’s emеrgency
I'm thankful 'cause I made it past my thirties, no one murdered me
Still remember vividly the nigga that pulled a gun on me
I'm petrified, but moving like I got no sense of urgency
Pride make a nigga act way harder than he really be
Pride hide the shame of sin and cut off all utilities
Pride hide the pain of growing up in hell and poverty
Pride make a nigga feel a way that you unfollow me
Make a nigga flash a thousand like he hit the lottery
Make a baby mama make shit harder than it gotta be
Make you have to take the bitch to court to see your prodigy
Make you have to use your last resort and pull a robbery
Pride be the reason for the family dichotomy
Got uncles and some aunties that's too proud to give apologies
Slowly realizing what the root of all my problems be
It got me feeling different when somebody say they proud of me
[Chorus: J. Cole]
Pride is the Devil, uh
I think it got a hold on me
Pride is the Devil, uh
It left so many R.I.P. 
Pride is the Devil
I think it got a hold on me
Pride is the Devil, uh, yeah

[Post-Chorus: J. Cole]
Terrified, paranoid, I'll put you over everything to fill the void
And when you're gone, will I have anything or will I be destroyed? Uh
Terrified, paranoid, I'll put you over everything to fill the void
And when you’re gone, will I have anything or will I be destroyed? Yeah

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Too much money to count, what’s the amount? Check never bounce
I gotta pay a nigga to add it up
Then pay somebody to make sure whatever amount he say he can back it up
Got racks on racks, I'm rackin’ up
Stackin' up, you're reachin' out, actin’ up

[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
Break it down, weigh it up, now bag it up
Making five a month, that's regular
Nigga playing with us, that's a negative
Go back to start, that's never
I'm a boss, my closet leather
Ain't no off-days on my schedule
Long as I live, we live forever
Told my twin this shit get better
These niggas done slipped, let me ahead of 'em
Got my feet up, I paid seventy bands to have sex on the jet
I don't need 'em, that shit in the past, I'm feelin' like what's next
Got my speed up, foot all on the gas, this not a C8 'Vette
I can beat 'em, I believe in me, just tell me what's the bet
All my pride gone, had to lose it all then I got rich
I own five homes, glad some of this shit starting to make sense
I'm staying hella focused and I can't forget the bigger picture
I can't even hold you, I didn't have shit, I won't forget it
Will I be destroyed?
Come to me with everything, it's starting to get annoying
I'm addicted to promethazine, it's crazy, yeah, I know it
All this money coming in, it drive me crazy not to show it
I'll be crazy if I blow it
[Chorus: J. Cole]
Pride is the Devil, uh
I think it got a hold on me
Pride is the Devil, uh
And it left so many R.I.P. 
Pride is the Devil
I think it got a hold on me
Pride is the Devil, uh
